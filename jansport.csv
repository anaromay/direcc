I ordered mine and she was absolutely right, it applies very easy and it feels like it's protecting the screen better then what I had before, there is still some glare and my fingerprints show up pretty easily so I'm not too sure on the anti-smudge, but the glass cover has a smoothness that makes it easy for me to use my IPad and for using my Apple Pencil with.

I was always worried about my toddlers breaking my tablet and now I know it’s safe for the most part. Because let’s face it kids are the devil when it comes to mommy’s stuff.

Edit 1/16/2020
I just have to say that this brand of screen protectors are some of THE best I've ever had. My toddlers play on the tablet ALOT. They drop and do all the things you are scared of them doing. My tablet has held up like a champ. I have some cracks in the protective glass but the tablet itself is looking like the day I got it.

UPDATE!","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 30 de diciembre de 2016","So much for gliding stickers. Mine came off as I was gently putting the glass over my iPad, which then messed up my alignment, which then led to me having to try to fix the issue and in turn getting dust attached to the adhesive side of the screen! Tons of bubbles resulted. Giving it two stars because it did seem like it would have fit beautifully and it was packaged well. Overall, disappointed.

UPDATE: Sparin contacted me immediately after my review and offered to send me another screen protector free of charge with some suggestions of how to change my method. Basically I did not use the guide stickers this time (peeled back half, aligned, pulled back other half, then ran my finger down the middle to allow it to adhere). This method worked MUCH better. I suggest doing this, or if you really want to use the hinge method to use additional tape and not the guide stickers provided. Great customer service though!

Guide stickers do not stick!  Screen full of dust.","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 13 de enero de 2018","The 2 star rating isn't necessarily for the tempered glass itself, but for the means of installation.  It should be first noted that my kit did not come with the dust removal sticker, so I was unable to complete that step as written in the instructions, as well as the steps in the video on YouTube. I always apply my own screen protectors to my devices, so I have relatively good experience with placing screen protectors.  When applying this one however, the screen protector kept sliding around as I was trying to measure the placement due to the protective sticker on the protector.  Also, when trying to place the guide stickers onto the screen protector for alignment, they always kept popping off and I would have to realign the screen and press the guide sitckers on again (this happened 3 times). I cleaned the screen as instructed, and as noted before, I could not complete the dust sticker removal step, as my kit did not come with one.  Dust still remained on my screen because of the microfiber cloth (keep in mind, I was installing the protector in a relatively dust-free area).  After removing the protective sticker from the glass, I flipped the glass as instructed and the guide stickers once again came off, adding more time to the installation process, therefore allowing some dust to settle onto the adhesive side of the tempered glass. There are dust particles stuck under the glass now and there are still some bubbles remaining. Very disappointed.","2.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Most of these things, including this one is made to be as  cheap as possible and most profit.  I ripped this one off my iPad and threw it in the trash.  Not even worth returning.

What I don't like.... too glossy and not matt finish so a lot of glare.  It's not glass and falsely implied in the ad and on the box.  It is a polycarbonate.  Thus it is very static like when installing and attracts dust that you must be super careful to remove during installation.  It leaves even more fingerprints than by using the iPad directly.  It's also just a bit too large.  They try to go edge to edge on the iPad so when putting the iPad in a tight case, the edges of the product  are pushed up or in with pressure and come away from the surface slightly.  It also annoys me that when pressing the home button, I feel the edges of the cutout circle as the product is thick.

I'll go back to try and find the older style very think coatings that don't have the above problems.  They might be a bit more delicate to install, but none of the downsides.  I already have a case that mainly protects the iPad so this this plastic is a nuisance.","1.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I followed the directions exactly ... washing hands first, putting on the 'hinge' stickers, prepping the surfaces exactly. The iPad's screen was spotless, however when I pulled off the protective film from the backside of the protector, there was a tiny (like microscopic) piece of dust or lint on it (not the iPad screen, the protector). I don't know if it was just bad luck that it got there in that moment, or if it was on the protector to begin with, but it made an ugly bubble once the screen laid down. I had to remove the protector and try again, and it wouldn't come off and there were three new bubbles around the edges - I decided to stop trying to make it perfect, and just live with it. My concern is more of protection than aesthetics - after all this is for my son. None of the bubble are over the screen portion.

I'm usually good with things like alignment and precision, but you almost need to do this in a clean room to get it to work like the pictures and videos show. If I was using this professionally where appearances matter, I wouldn't recommend spending money on this unless you have a professional do it for you. Rather I'd just get a good folding case and be careful with it. But I am hopeful that the value is in how well it protects, and time will tell if that's the case.

Also, if you plan on putting your iPad in a tight-fitting case (my son's is in a keyboard case), I would NOT recommend trying to put the protector on first and then put the iPad in the case. My experience was that caused the protector to shift around.","3.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The cut out for the home button was ...","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 14 de septiembre de 2017","The packaging and instructions were top notch. The protector itself seems very nice. The cut out for the home button was not ""on center"". It was slightly offset from the actual home button. I may be picky by it seems a simple fix would be making the hole a little bigger. It is unpleasant to feel the edge of the cut out every time you touch the home button. Also, I wasn't expecting the entire top of the screen protector would be cut short to accommodate the face camera hole. Seems a simple fix to just cut out around the hole so the screen protector covers more of the top of the screen. As it is the screen protector stops about 1/2"" from the top of the iPad. I will be returning this.
UPDATE: in my initial review I critiqued the size of the screen not covering the entire screen. While in function this may be true it makes little difference in the long run. When I finally installed it the process was simple. Not sure why folks are complaining about bubbles. For me there were none. I am supposing the negative reviews have more to do with user error than the product itself. This product is going to preserve the resale value of my iPad 100 times over.

Because of my initial experience, I am holding back the fifth star.

My original review is below.
———————————————————————-

This appears to be a nice, high quality protector.

Unfortunately the installation is not as they say.

It bubbles, the corners lift, and strange red fibers appeared on the protector itself.

I may have had a bad one.

I did attempt the recommended relift/replace procedure, however the protector attracts dust ( electrostatic ? ) and both sides of the protector became coated with dust.

It does seem to attract dust to the surface, which isn’t helpful.

Unfortunately I cannot rate the durability, as the product was not able to be properly installed.

The last thing I want is a perpetually obscured screen.","4.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It covers the entire glass almost seamlessly. There's a tiny gap on one side but it's unnoticeable with my covers on. The edges are rounded and smooth so using the button isn't irritating.

The protector was really easy to apply, much easier than my phone's protector. It comes with the standard wet and dry wipes, microfibre cloth and squeegee card. I didn't even need the card. I laid it down button edge first and let it fall. A slight push in the middle made all the bubbles go away.

The protector's oleophobic properties are working great so far, much better than the original screen. There are still a few smudges here and there, but I clean my screen a whole lot less now. I use a generic stylus sometimes to reduce fingerprints but now I use my fingers more because there are less prints.

The ipad was sitting on my desk, after half an hour I go and pick up a pen that rolled on the floor, the cord got stuck in the arm rest of my chair and when I turned the chair it yanked the ipad off the desk and it went screen first into the floor and made noise even with headphones on.  My heart sank the second I heard the noise, I pick it up and the first thing I notice are 3 big cracks.  I couldnt tell if it was the protector only or the screen too.  I slowly peeled the protector off and to my relief the screen was in the exact condition as it was when I put the protector on. I figured over time this protector would eventually get a scratch or two if I'm not lucky.  I've put these protectors on all my phones and never once did a drop from a few feet or sometimes even further leave any marks really.

Grimm","Adhesive side arrived dusty/fuzzy (UPDATED review)","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 22 de diciembre de 2018","Ordered this to go with my son's new iPad for Christmas. Having a 5 year old...screen protector is a must. I usually go with a diff brand but having the Holiday time crunch and after reading reviews, I went with this product. The protector states its glass, but mine is plastic. Christmas is a few days away so I thought to install anyways. Wasnt to happy to find the adhesive side was already smattered w a fuzzy type particulate under the protective film (sandwiched between screen protector and plastic film). I used the ""dust absorber"" sticker gently to get as much off as possible and applied ""glass"" protector. Corners wont adhere and have bubbles. Will deal with it through Christmas and then buy a more trusted brand immediately after. Wouldnt reccomend this screen protector.
EDIT: Seller reached out to us and offered a replacement screen free of charge. Original review was 2 stars, have now bumped to 4 stars (1 star deduction still for inconvenience/product quality first time around). New screen was clean and actual glass. Applied easily/smoothly/cleanly. Would recommend quality of the new screen and was impressed with customer service.","4.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Also, I read many reviews that said that no matter how much they cleaned they still got bubbles due to lint. Thats exactly what happened to me. I was installing protector onto my brand new iPad. Even though it was brand new, we still cleaned it. There was absolutely no lint or dust on it. We install this cover and there are 4 bubbles due to dust/lint trapped underneath. This cover I guess is static and attracts dust and lint and pulls it in not the sticky side. So now I have permanent bubbles.
So I am confused. This company reaches out to unhappy customers (which is nice) but keeps on selling effective product? Do you notice many many reviews dating their rating due to great customer service? How about getting product fixed so that it doesn't have static and attract dust/lint. How about product getting better instead of great customer service. Well, anyway I have bubbles and its awful.
Update: one big bubble is left, tiny ones disappeared. Still not good and distracting but at least is not many.","3.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In the past I have HATED applying screen protectors, but this was a dream come true!  I followed their instructional video carefully:  Make hinge with stickers (to guide the sheet later).  Clean screen with the wet and dry wipes they provide.  Remove any final dust with their dust removal sticker.  Pull protective plastic off the glass sheet.  Swing glass screen protector into place and swipe it once, lengthwise across the center, with 1 finger.  Then I watched in amazement as the screen protector just sucked itself into place, eliminating all air underneath.  At first it looked like there might be a couple of bubbles near the edges but the thing just kept sucking itself tighter onto my ipad until it was perfectly sealed.

You really have to get your iPad, iPhone super clean and not a speck of dust anywhere. And then line up the screen protector with your iPad screen precisely. Don't rush it, let it grab your screen and push out the bubbles on its own. After, take your finger to push out any bubbles left. Push them all the same direction or they won't get out. You can redo, but ideally is best to get it right the first time. Whatever you do, do NOT touch the sticky side AT ALL once you pull back the film. This will only create a forever smudge on your screen because of it. Basically just follow the directions exactly. Awesome and great product, durable and packaged very nicely.

I watched the YouTube video that was recommended on the instruction sheet before beginning the installation so I would know exactly what to do and what not to do. All went well on the installation until, in spite of my best efforts, I got a couple of small dust particles on the screen that were on the viewing area. The video did not cover how to remove them but I had read another review that said to carefully lift the protector from the corner, use the dust remover the remove the particles FROM THE STICKY BACK OF THE PROTECTOR (in other words, “upside down”)and let the protector return to position. During this process, additional dust crept onto the protector nearer the edge and I carefully repeated the process.  I finally have a screen with no dust bubbles in the viewing area but the corner that was lifted no longer is adheared to the screen.  That’s really no big deal and I’m sure the screen is protected but it does show and bothers me.

And the screen protector itself is great. I just put it on with no problem (I did watch the video, being an easily-led person), and I expect it to serve me well. In the past I've had film screen protectors, which in fact have worked just fine, but this was easier to put on and should afford even better protection.
One trick I remember from installing my previous covers: do it on a good flat surface in a bathroom after having run the shower for 3-4 minutes and then waited 5"": as it settles, the steam will drag any dust out of the air in an already relatively dust-free space.

The tempered glass screen protector comes packaged in what almost looks like a book; it's a hard cardboard case that opens just like a book and protects the heck out of the product, A hard squishy rubber barrier further encases the screen protector within; then it's even wrapped up in more protection like a poly envelope that you can just slide it out of. I followed the manufacturers advice and watched the YouTube video on installation (search for SPARIN A09) and I felt confident enough I could do it. I did use the hinge method recommended (I had read some reviews where people didn't like it) but I thought if I started with the hinges and felt uncomfortable or like it wasn't lining up then I just wouldn't use them.

I was comparing it to more and a lot more expensive screen protectors and debating with myself which to buy.  I decided to give this one a chance, based on other reviews.

I am using the screen protector with Targus Versavu Rotating 9.7 inch case for iPad (model THZ63403GL-52).  Both fit PERFECTLY and have a very high quality feel.  When scrolling, the finger glides over the protector in the same way it would if it were not there.

The installation was a breeze and I do not quite understand those who complain the installation is difficult. SPARIN provided a Youtube video, however, I would suggest the following approach that is slightly different.

1. Instead of hinging the screen on the short side of the iPad, hinge it on the long side using all three stickers that are provided.
2. Once you finally peel off the film and lay the screen carefully down on the iPad, DO NOT swipe your finger across the iPad, as shown in the video. That will very likely create bubbles, just like it did in the video. Instead, just put your index finger in the center of the screen and watch the magic do its work.

Or just a template to hold it in the right spot. Everything that comes with this screen protector, to install, is of good quality. You just have to be very good at getting all the dust, dirt and things off the screen, and then getting the airbubbles out once the screen is on top of the iPad. It finally worked out for me... with two small airbubbles, but I am glad I have this protector!!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have never had the device screen crack or scratch when I have these applied.
Easy to install. No bubbles. Effective pre-installation cleaning kit and the instructions are easy to understand and follow.
I have never seen a totally smudge proof screen, it just happens b/c of the natural oils and lotions on our hands. This screen does wipe off easily with included screen cloth and there are no lasting smudges right after wiping or cleaning.","5.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’m normally pretty good at installing these things. This one? The worst. Bubble free? Hardly. Hassle free? Yea ok. The tape they send to help install this didn’t stick so those were useless. Unless you live in a house that has no dust particles you’re going to have some small bubbles from the dust. I’m ok with that. What I’m wasn’t ok with is the air bubbles that refused to disappear no matter what I tried. I followed the directions completely and has so much trouble installing this and there were so many bubbles and so much dust from lifting and replacing it so many times trying to get rid of the bubbles I finally lost patience and threw it in the trash.

All of the materials for prepping the screen came packaged nicely as well.  Unfortunately, the screen protector itself appears to have had several specs of dust/dirt underneath the protective film - not noticeable prior to installing the screen protector, but very noticeable once the protector is on the iPad.  I've read that other buyers have had similar issues.  It is unfortunate, because the screen protector is otherwise great, just a case of faulty packaging.

*EDIT*
Note that this is an update to my original review.  I had originally given this 2 out of 5, despite quite liking the product.
The customer service has changed my mind and I'm willing to give this a 5 out of 5.  Alisa from iMaxas reached out to me immediately regarding my review above, and a replacement protector was sent to me.  This was a completely unexpected level of customer service - very much appreciated.  The replacement protector was particle free and installed perfectly.  Despite the low price, this seems to be a quality screen protector.  It works really well with my Apple Pencil, including pressure recognition for apps that support it.  I will note that drawing/writing with the Pencil feels similar to drawing/writing on a white board rather than paper, however this was never marketed as a paper solution.  If you are looking for a screen protector that feels like paper, consider looking at a matte protector - something that feels grainier.  However, I've enjoyed my time with the protector.  It is a quality product and the customer service is incredible.

One last thing to mention - there is a 2 pack for almost the same price as this one pack.  Buy that one.","5.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The biggest issue with this kit is that it only ships with one piece of tempered glass whereas the other kits I""ve purchased from other manufacturers shipped with a second screen protector.

The pull tab to remove the plastic sheet from the tempered glass is at the top, and no camera cutout hole or other cue is available to properly align the protector.  There is only one hole cut out for the home button, and aligning the tempered glass from the top of the ipad down to to the home button is challenging.  If a second hole was present for the camera, installation alignment would be far easier. Alternatively, if the pull tab was located on the bottom of the glass near the home cut out, the alignment would be much easier.

Once installed, the touch screen interface works flawlesslly and screen color is unchanged.  The protector has been installed for less than an hour, and I can't speak to the product's durability.

The overall margin of error to install this kit accurately is extremely narrow, especially for an individual who has never emplaced a screen protector before. If the kit included a second screen protector, the process would be far more forgivable. Due to the installation challenges and, more importantly, the absence of a second piece off glass, I highly recommend looking for a different product.","2.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They will replace and they tracked me down to tell me so too.

I just placed the new protector they sent without using the hinges. I worked well. I had no problems this time and no bubbles or dust.

The “hinges” kept coming off of the screen protector top. The last time it happened, I had just removed the backing.  I ended up with dust specks and bubbles that were very difficult to remove. It was all messed up by then and I ended up just trashing the thing.  I’ve done plenty of these before. The hinge gimmick looked like it would make things easier but it did not. I should have done without the guides. Would have been much easier.  I’ll stick with the ones I know work well even though a couple dollars more. The reviews on this led me astray this time. I even used the video. These things really aren’t difficult if you follow directions but the “hinges” caused a lot of scrambling for a good hold when they kept falling off.

Seller contacted me and offered replacement, which I did not want given the lack of installation hardware vs ""stickers"" used for alignment.  They offered and provided a refund, which was generous.

As I mentioned in my original review, the glass took three attempts to align properly, but it is holding on my son's iPad.  The glass is clear and appears to be of the quality represented. ***

Terrible installation experience.  Sticky tabs to create a “hinge” to align are useless and don’t stick to glass when attempting to adhere. Needs a guide template like every other respectable brand comes with.

Glass hardness seems fine, took three attempts to adhere however, so time will tell if it sticks.

Buy another brand that has a true installation template, not worthless stickers and and a joke of a YouTube installation video.","4.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Everything looked decent except there was a bit of dirt underneath the screen protector. I took it off in an attempt to clean the protector. That's a no go on this one. As soon as I tried to clean it it made the proctector really smudgy and look terrible. This seems like it will be a good screen protector but I would highly recommend making sure you don't have a fan on during installation. I'll be purchasing another to try again. Hopefully I can give his more stars after that.

**Update- Since my last review this company's customer service team reached out to me. They replaced the previous screen protector and gave detailed instructions on how to install. I took my time this time to make sure there was absolutely no dust under the screen protector. This time things went great. The screen protector went on with no problems and does a great job.

A few days after I posted a 3-star review complaining about an apparent quality control issue (particulate matter stuck to underside of the protector *inside* the protective sheet), I received a direct email from a company representative apologizing for the problem and offering a free replacement. I was very busy & didn't respond to the email at first, so I received a 2nd email with the same offer a couple of days later. I emailed back, verified my shipping address, and a few days later a new package was on my front porch. I waited overnight for it to warm up to room temperature, removed the defective protector from the iPad, and installed the new protector after very, VERY carefully inspecting it and using the installation kit to clean the iPad's screen. There were no adhesion problems, very few bubbles (all of which were easily cleared in a matter of moments), and only one tiny imperfection that is literally invisible without a magnifying glass and a careful search. I am very pleased with the replacement product and happily shocked at the exemplary customer service. (To repeat, the company contacted me with an apology & no-strings-attached replacement before I had the chance to contact them.) As of now, I'll definitely buy from them again as needed in the future.

One quick note: As mentioned in my original review, there are stick-on tabs to create a ""hinge"" to help position the screen protector prior to installation. This time around I did not use them and found it easier to carefully position the screen protector the old-fashioned way. If you buy this product I recommend practice fitting the protector (BEFORE removing the film covering the adhesive!) with the hinges so you can tell if it would be easier for you to place it correctly with or without them -- I'm sure the choice will vary among buyers.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've used tempered glass screen protectors on a variety of devices, and the reviews of this one led to high expectations. I was amazed at how well-packaged it is: a semi-rigid heavy cardboard ""book"" style folder, with a separate ""installation kit"" inside along with the screen protector itself in a protective sleeve and an internal frame keeping everything in place & protected.

Unlike my experience with several other similar (smaller) protectors of other brands, the installation kit was complete and -- hooray! -- the ""wet"" wipe was actually wet. (Be careful opening the installation kit; I accidentally tore off a small part of the instruction booklet.) The first thing I noticed was more complete/complex instructions than I'd expected, along with a note saying I should view an instructional video on YouTube. The video came up right where it was supposed to be, but I immediately noticed that it skipped over 1 step in the printed directions (use the dry wipe after the wet wipe but before the microfiber cloth), and did not show or mention the stiff card (size of a credit card) intended to help move bubbles out from under the screen protector as the final installation step.

One very helpful feature of the installation kit was ""hinge"" stickers that let you pre-position the protector and then swing it out of the way to thoroughly clean the iPad screen, then just swing it back into place for installation already in the correct position... at least in theory. I still had to be very careful positioning the protector because the stickers still allow a bit more side-to-side wiggle than is perhaps absolutely necessary. It was when the protector was in place and beginning to adhere to the iPad screen when things went a bit sour.

Before using the installation kit, I had buffed the iPad with a clean microfiber cloth until it shined. I then used the installation kit's wet wipe, making sure to cover every tiny bit of the surface, followed by careful wiping with the kit's dry wipe. I then buffed the iPad with the microfiber cloth from the installation kit, followed by the included ""dust absorber"" (a big sticker you lightly tap all over the screen to pull off any dust particles that somehow were missed in all the preceding steps). At every step, I carefully inspected the iPad for dust, fingerprints, and any other kind of marking, checking it at multiple angles in direct & indirect lighting. (I can be a little obsessive when it comes to screen protectors.) I checked the screen protector one more time at different angles, and saw a few little spots I decided were probably dirt on the protective film. I then peeled the protective film off the back of the screen protector, swung it down onto the iPad, and began pressing out a few bubbles...

...only to find 7-8 bits of kind of particulate matter causing permanent bubbles scattered across the screen (not to mention the entire upper left 1/8 of the screen protector not sticking nearly as well as the rest of it). I peeled the protector back, did some more cleaning, reapplied the protector, and had the same particles in the same spots. I then very gently used the ""dust absorber"" directly on the sticky side of the screen protector and reapplied it for a second time, and was rewarded with just a few small bubbles I was able to manipulate out.

As of now, the upper left 1/8 of the screen protector seems to be sitting on the iPad screen and not actually adhering to it (that's 1 star off), and I'm a bit annoyed at how I had to clean particulate matter off the supposedly clean & protected *sticky* side of the screen protector (that's the 2nd star off). For the moment it seems to be staying in place & remaining clean, but I'll have to think twice about another of the same brand in the future.","5.0 de 5 estrellas","",""

Unfortunately this one doesn't live up to their reputation.
First, I have to say that I pride myself on being able to install these protectors perfectly, with no dust or bubbles. I know it sounds like hubris, but I do it for all of my friends and family members because of the results I'm able to get. It's a limited talent, but it's what I've got.
However, I cannot get the edges and the holes to line up with this screen protector. There is a noticeable ripple and curvature to the edges. It's simply not cut correctly. It's difficult enough to get right, due to the size of the thing, but because the cutouts don't line up it's impossible to have the edges aligned with the sides and the holes centered around the sensor and camera. If it was only slightly off it would be fine, but if I center the holes one edge hangs off just enough to not stick down. I finally got it close enough but the corners and parts of the edge don't adhere. It's not in the visible area, so I wasn't concerned, but over time the gaps are spreading farther into the screen area. It's slowly peeling itself off. Picture attached.
I contacted Sparin, and while they agreed to send a replacement, their attitude was that my installation was clearly at fault. They made it clear that they did not consider this a warranty issue. They said they would, out of the goodness of their hearts, give me ONE MORE to try again. There is not one spec of dust under it, and it is lined up with the sides as perfectly as I could get it.
I will try the replacement in the hope that this was a rare factory defect, but based on the poor quality control, and the attitude of their customer service, if it doesn't work I won't buy another one from Sparin. I've deducted a star for each issue.

Update: I received a replacement and it installed correctly on the first try. The edges are straight and it sealed down with no bubbles. One small tip of a corner doesn’t seal completely, but that is perfectly acceptable with a piece this size.","3.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was the easiest experience I’ve ever had with putting these types of things on devices. I didn’t believe it when it said it doesn’t bubble, but it’s true*! (*you have to be sure to clean the screen well, and make sure not dust particles make their way to the edges as the screen is setting in). I don’t know why other screen protectors don’t include “guidance stickers” which basically allows you to create hinges so jar way you can position the screen properly and not just hope that it falls into the correct place. The kit comes with cleaning wipes (both wet and dry), a cleaning cloth, a little card to help the protector settle on to the screen, and even a sticker to help take any remaining dust particles before you place the protector.

This was definitely the best option for the price and I’m completely satisfied with my experience.

Everything you could ask for, except it didnt work. Mfg claims that simply r7nning your finger down the middle of the glass will kick off installing itself. Mine never did.

Update: mfg saw my review and sent me email offering to provide me with another protector to have me try again. They also suggested I watch several Youtube videos on how to install the screen protector.  Its a good thing I did because the videos provide different instructions than the mfg’s written instruction included with the product. This begs the question, why doesnt the mfg change their instructions? Following the video instructions, I was able to successfully install the screen protector in about 5 minutes.....and it largely installed itself.

The directions also refer you to a video on YouTube if you want even more information on how to install.  I watched the short video as I was installing it step by step.  It was extremely user friendly and the screen is perfect.  I don't really think most people would even need the video but I wanted to make sure I didn't have any bubbles in the screen.

The problem I have is with the installation instructions and how brittle the glass is.  The instructions included were not made for iPad screen protectors, but instead were for iPhone protectors.  The assumption was there is no difference, but there is a little difference.. still, it shows the company wanted to save a few bucks by just re-using the iPhone instructions.  Second, instructions do not explain in English which side of the screen is ""up"" when it instructs you to tape anchor it down.  After anchoring it down I discovered I had the wrong side up and when trying to remove and replace the anchor tape, the screen cracked.  This leads me to believe that the screen is very delicate and would probably crack very easily after installed.

Dust specs became adhered to guard when guide stickers failed.","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 14 de mayo de 2020","Read the instructions and watched the installation video on youtube. Used the guide stickers and did everything as instructed. When I went to remove the backing off the guard, the stupid guide stickers came off and ended up getting a few specs of dust stuck to the guard. Huge pain to install but once it’s on it does its job. I don’t see any “anti-glare” at work, it reflects light and glares just as the original screen did. As for the anti-smudge, I guess it works to some degree. Definitely not as many noticeable finger prints on the screen than what would be there without the guard. No bubbles, just the specs of dust from where the guide stickers came off and the guard tapped the table and gathered dust from it before I was able to get it lined up well enough. Which I had to do by eye because the guide stickers were useless. Hope someone has a better experience than me. I would say it’s still worth the money. If you use something with a little better adhesion than the stickers, it would probably make installation a lot easier.","3.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Original review: The product was packaged better than any similar items I have ordered online or at a store. The protector itself was exactly what I was hoping for. The instructions and set up kit were well thought out with one problem. The hinges were a poor method of applying the protector to the surface. I spent a lot of time preparing the surface and aligning to protector, but using the sticker hinges caused the device to be misaligned. On the second attempt it was better aligned but had particles underneath (I didn’t clean because it was only up for 15-30 seconds. I wish I had read more reviews about the application. I really want this product. I’ve never used one for more than a day or so because none seemed this quality. So for now I’ll have no protector unless I buy another one of these.

No matter how closely I followed the instructions, I was always left with permanent bubbles under the screen protector, or worse, trapped dust particles.  After spending a large chunk of money for my Apple iPad I knew I would need to install a screen protector to protect my investment.  Of course, based on past experiences I dreaded the whole process.  So after searching for a suitable screen protector on Amazon and reading the reviews, I settled on this one from SPARIN.  Once it arrived, I watched the recommended installation video on YouTube.  In fact, I watched it during the install as well, pausing the video as I completed each step.  To my amazement, the screen protector was quite simple to install, and it turned out perfectly.  No trapped dust, no bubbles, just a sleek, shiny awesome looking screen protector.  This particular glass screen protector does not affect the sensitivity of the touchscreen at all, unlike some I have used in the past.  To sum it all up, this is a high-quality product which was very easy to install.  It looks and feels great on my iPad.  Best of all, I installed it myself without any hassles.

Before the product even arrived, I had received an email from the seller/product company.  The email thanked me for my purchase and also told me how to go online and watch a video of how to install the screen protector.  The email also said to contact the seller if I had any troubles or needed anything.  I thought this was very good customer service to get an email even before the product had arrive.  Usually I find customer service to be very reactive, and this was a very proactive approach which I liked.

After the product arrived, I watched the recommended video, along with a couple of additional videos on how to install the screen saver.  I tried to followed the videos on how to install but I still had a little trouble installing the screen saver.  There are tabs included that you are suppose to stick to the screen saver and the Ipad and use them like a hinge.  However, these tabs did not stick to the Ipad very well and would slip and move.  This would throw off the alignment of the screen saver.  I finally had to get someone to help me and help hold the tabs in place and finally get the screen saver located where I wanted it.  For me it was a little more difficult to install then the videos I had watched, but it wasn't terrible.

Overall the product is good it is now protecting my screen and I don't have any scratches or smudges on the original screen.  Outside of the small difficulty I had installing the screen saver the only other downside I have found is that it adds some glare to the screen that wasn't there before.

It has a premium feel as soon as you open the box, and I definitely appreciated the inclusion of the install kit. The protector itself is very nice too, study glass that feels very nice and seems protective. However, it is really difficult to get this thing on. When I put it on at first there were so many little bubbles everywhere I had to spend 20+ minutes adjusting it and scraping away with that little bubble remover thing. Even now there are still a few bubbles left I can’t get out, though they are mostly not on the edges now. I might have to get another one and try again, but we’ll see.

Davis","Installation is not as easy and instructions suggest.","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 17 de noviembre de 2016","Nice idea for installation - doesn't exactly work they way they describe.

I thought the idea with the ""hinges"" was a good idea. However, when I lifted the screen protector up on the hinges to remove the backing - the hinges promptly fell off of the screen protector. So I just eyeballed it and placed it on the screen.

Second - there needs to be some sort of card to help push out bubbles. The directions state that once the protector is affixed to the screen - you just slide your finger up and down along the iPad screen and it will ""automatically attach"" to the screen. Not exactly. I spent several minutes trying to work out the bubbles - and the screen protector is so thick, that I had to exert a lot of pressure to force the bubbles towards the edge - and I was worried about how much pressure I was putting on my new iPad screen.

If I had realized this screen protector was so thick - I probably wouldn't have purchased it. I'm more concerned about protecting from smudges and small scratches - I don't need something this thick.","3.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased it for my iPad Pro 9.7"", and it was a very easy installation. The glass is smooth, and collects less fingerprints than the iPad's regular glass with no screen protector. It also cleans off fingerprints easier than without a screen protector. My first protector was defective, and part of it wasn't attaching to the general center area of the screen, while also making the screen not very responsive to touch. I contacted Sparin through Amazon, and was set up with a replacement screen protector in under an hour. With Amazon Prime (and living near a warehouse), I had a new screen protector the next business day. Super easy, and hassle free. My replacement screen protector was perfect, and I'm happily using it now.
I do not yet have a case for my iPad Pro, so I don't know how the screen protector will work with a case.

It's smooth, doesn't effect the sensitivity of screen, and of corse there will be bubbles that can not be smoothed out over shatters. There were no bubbles where they hairline cracks were. I found it easier to Google video instructions and then the directions made more sense. Step one only says to place hinge stickers on back, I put them on wrong before watching a video. I didn't leave quite enough length to fold over the top of the screen to hold the protector. So when I removed the stickers to replace them they were not as sticky. Make sure you do this on a flat surface so there is enough room for the protector to lay beside the iPad or the stickers will start peeling off the protector, which probably would not have happened if I didn't have to replace he stickers.","5.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I found installation a little more finicky than with the larger Tech Armor screen cover for a 12.9"" iPad Pro.  That said the screen is clean, clear, bright and no apparent loss of touch sensitivity.  I cannot imagine relying on any screen protector alone to prevent damage due to drops/impact.

Factor","Installation system is bad, product is good.","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 10 de enero de 2018","I just installed this on my iPad 2017. The protector is extremely clear, thin, and lightweight.  Basically invisible.

However it was a struggle to get it properly applied. I read the instructions, I watched the YouTube videos, so it wasn’t me. The system provided is just not easy to use.

The protector is so slippery that getting it to hold still while you properly apply the “hinges” is almost impossible. I had to retry multiple times. If it moves, it won’t be properly aligned when you actually put it on.

Great care is then needed to get the protector on without reintroducing dust, because there is no remaining handle after you expose the adhesive.

I seem to end up buying a different brand of screen protector every time I get a new device, so I have used a bunch of different application systems. This one was the worst.

I’ve applied it this afternoon, and after hours of inspecting it, and testing it out it proves to be a great protector. Everything is literally crystal clear, and it looks as if nothing is applied at all. It has a very nice feel to it. My finger feels very comfortable gliding across the glass. It arrived in a book like premium case so it wouldn’t get damaged during shipping and handling which is very great. It also came with clear and easy instructions on how to install it on your iPad. The only thing is that the guidelines didn’t help me all that well, so I chose to install it without it. Now it worked for me because I’m used to installing tempered glass on phones so I know how to install them without additional help, but I’m not trying to discredit their use. They just weren’t for me. My installation came out fine, and I’m happy. Unfortunately after examining it I somehow got a teeny, tiny black spec of debris on the bottom left corner of my iPad, but that was my fault as I was rushing. You’re going to experience bubbles as that’s something that generally happens with all protected but a good firm push right after you apply the protector, and they’ll smooth right out.

Follow the directions and you shouldn't have any problems with air bubbles or dust under the protector.  One difference I did note from the other brand I was used to is that there was no hole in the top of the protector for the user-facing camera lens.

The claim that you can stick it on the screen and pull it up if you made a mistake during alignment, isn't true.  There was a portion of the glass NOT sticking onto the iPad screen and no matter what I did, it'd lift enough just to know it was there. Fortunately, that unused portion of the screen (the surrounding glass frame around the screen) is covered by the protective cover I'm using so it's actually being sandwiched down at all times and out of sight.  Without that, I would I have probably sent it back.

When you apply this cover, MAKE SURE YOU ARE TOTALLY ALIGNED BEFORE YOU STICK the tempered glass protective cover onto the iiPad's screen!

For the record, I kept the NewTrent because it was much better and more secure.

Anyway, the screen protector is easy to instal. I never use the ""hinge"" technique they tell you to use when installing it. I just lined it up using the cut-out for Home button/bottom edge and slowly lowered it onto the screen; readjusting it slightly as I lowered it. Works every time for me.

So why 4 stars? the claim that it's coated in an oligophobic layer (for smudge resistance) only lasted MAYBE half a day. But that's typical for almost all the screen protectors out there.

Update: wonderful customer service. They sent me a replacement to give it another  shot. By the time it came in the mail, the first one was lifting from the side about 2-3 inches.

Most covers are a thin film that does not protect the case; however, this cover is very thick tempered glass.  Sparin  included a cleaning wipe & several cleaning ""tapes"" that did an excellent job removing dust particles when covering the iPad. It took several attempts to place the glass exactly right without any small dust particles but the thickness of the glass made it extremely easy.  Due to the fact that there is NO sticky stuff on the glass to deal with, placement was excellent if you make a mistake with alignment.

I bought this screen protector because...
1) I serve in developing countries filming for nonprofits (through Knok Studio) and I put a ton of stress on my devices and...
2) I have 2 young children.  Who are also on the road with me, serving in tough-on-technology countries.

So I thought, ""Why not add a 10 dollar added layer of protection to my $400 device?"" Right?

But in the long run I found this iPad screen protector doesn't really add that much to the apparent protection.  For me the amount of 'stickiness' you get (compared to the smooth iPad glass) is not worth it. Plus the possibility of putting this protector on without getting dust underneath is slim to none.  (see end of video and note all the bubbles around the edges... and I followed the instructions meticulously)

Honestly I would simply invest in a quality case that folds over the glass when not in use (like a book).

Do note: For a smart phone, it's different. I would actually suggest a screen protector because a small, phone device is always jostling up against keys in your pocket. iPads and tablets are different; when you're toting them around, they're always covered by the case.

Side note: If it's worth the gamble for you to buy and attempt a perfect, dust-free installation, more power to you. It's nice because if all else fails, there's no glue or sticky residue left on your original screen from this screen protector. So if you choose to peel it off and dispose of it (like I'm going to do most likely), your iPad is back to normal.  That's nice.

Hope this is helpful!

The install was extremely easy! For anyone who has ever installed a screen, we all know what a pain it can be.

It comes with a unique install plan that has you create a hinge. I added my own addition which was a 3rd tab on the opposite side of the hinge to swing the screen protector.

The only “con” was the cut of the material. I wish it had been cut to fit the thumb hole and the camera like my last screen protector. This one has a hole for the thumb but it is cut just below the camera instead of above it with a hole for the camera.","4.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Works fine with your fingers ... Haven't tried the pencil yet.

Installation is a little tricky... I tried to use the hinge method in the directions but the sticky paper wasn't sticky enough and they came loose, so I just placed the screen down using the edges to hold onto and slowly put it into place... It was on right but it had bubbles... I tried to move the bubbles from the center to the edges without much success, so I tried something different... I picked up the left side from the edge using a fingernail at the top and bottom and raised it up enough to create a gap to the middle of the screen and then let the screen protector back down slowly and all the bubbles disappeared.  Did the same thing on the right side with similar results.  Doing it like this doesn't change the alignment of the screen on the iPad since half is still sticking while the other half is relaid from the center out eliminating the bubbles.

Packaging, supplies, product quality ... all first rate.

SPARIN blows them all away. Not only was the installation practical and uncomplicated, once the glass melded to the screen, it all but vanished. Yes, you can see the edge... the button cutout is a hair bigger than the actual button... and the outer edge of the glass itself is also just a hair smaller than the surface of the device's face, not that it matters unless you have something that's 100% bezel-less. But other than this edge, the protector pretty much disappears. It feels like there's absolutely nothing between you and your screen.

Bottom line, from now on I will only buy SPARIN glass screen protectors. Even the price is fair. The packaging alone feels so premium you'll think you got a crazy discount on a high-end product. I bought these for both my wife's IPAD (6), and my Surface Pro 6.

-Extremely easy to install
-dust stickers were very helpful when removing pet hairs and dust
-feels better than the iPad screen itself

Cons:
-was a hard to push the bubbles out but it was much easier to just lift the screen and continually push the air out to prevent bubbles from forming
-because the protector goes to the outer edges of the screen, my case wasnt made for that extra height and pushes the screen up creating air pockets at the corners (as seen in the picture).
-perhaps a little too smooth (due to oleophobic coating) making it a bit harder to control the apple pencil when drawing
-finger prints only appear when my fingers are slightly moist (can only be seem when the screen is off) but disappears completely with a wipe of my sleeve so fingerprints are hardly an issue

Overall I love this product and it works well.

I appreciated the video showing the installation as well as providing ""guide"" stickers which are also very useful. Unfortunately this item has to be returned because I have never had any issues installing a screen protector before but after several attempts with this one, I was unable to eliminate either bubbles or dust.

But it didn’t last like I anticipated.
I use my Apple Pencil with my iPad constantly, especially for art, so scratches are something I have to be really careful to avoid because they really interfere with the smoothness of my Pencil strokes. Unfortunately small grains can get underneath the Pencil tip and when I press down on the Pencil, it will scratch the screen. So I have to use a screen protector to prevent scratching the actual screen. I anticipated small scratches like this from Pencil strokes and was fine with it not being totally scratch resistant as long as it protected my iPad and didn’t crack. But after only a couple weeks of using this protector, I found a crack all the way across the screen, and I had my case on it and hadn’t dropped it.

When I received the email from SPARIN asking me to review the product it still had not arrived due to a shipping error by Amazon. So basically the email just went unnoticed. When the product did arrive, I immediately was impressed by the packaging. A heavy weight box with a great presentation to even include an icon that read ""explosion proof."" I want to test that part. When I opened the box I again was impressed. The screen protector was surrounded by a foam rubber frame to protect it, and also encased by two protective layers of styrofoam wrap. The company enclosed all of its literature in an envelope that made me think I was getting a greeting card along with my screen protector. They even included a ""happy / not happy"" card that reiterates their desire to provide you a good product or they will do what they can to make it right.
As for the screen protector, it seems solid. It has been on my iPad for less than 24 hours, and as long as it stands up to the torture that I know I will put it through, I am beyond happy with my purchase.

I had no trouble actually putting it on and I didn’t need all of the extras for help. My issue is that I have lots of pets so flying pet hair IS a huge problem for me. So I had to do some prep work before attempting this. I cleaned my smallest bathroom and turned it into an actual “clean room”. I turned the exhaust fan off and central heat off so NOTHING would be flying around. I put on a full clean room suit, covered my hair and shoes. JUST KIDDING😹, but I did change my clothes so they were fur-free! Then I started the procedure: I cleaned the screen with their clean and dry wipes, then applied the protector as instructed. MOST IMPORTANT PART IS LINING IT UP! You really only get one shot because it will crack if you try to move it so make sure you are on target. Luckily I nailed it the first time and it went right on perfect! There was not a bubble, speck of dirt, or cat/dog fur to be found under the screen! I used the squeegee card to make sure it was completely affixed and VOILA! It is perfect. So most of you will not go to my silly extreme measures, but I have gone thru these things like qtips because of just haphazardly throwing them on. So it was worth the prep time to ensure this one did not end up in the trash. It is shiny and sooo strong and yet all of my touches and stylus work great with no issues. Hope it lasts and I don’t have to go thru this for a long time! Good luck. Let me know if this helpful to anyone.","5.0 de 5 estrellas","",""

1) Let the bottom part of the screen protector touch Ipad's bottom part of the screen edge
2) Align the home button circle with the screen protector hole
3) While still lifting the top two corners, try to align top corners
4) Gradually lower down the top corners which are being hold by two hands
5) If it doesn't fit the corner, lift your hands to re-position gently. It is very easy to come out.
6) If every corners are aligned properly let go of the two top corners
7) While you are letting go of the two corners, you will see air escaping from the protector. This is the most enjoyable moment :)

I read the instructions and watched the suggested YouTube instruction video. The process is simple enough. HOWEVER, I missed a small speck of dust in the corner as I was placing the protector.  I noticed it right away and lifted the corner (which is where it was, right near the edge) and used the dust absorber again. The dust is gone but now the corner won’t adhere to the glass no matter how many times I tried to smooth it out, it just lifts again. Also, the area where I lifted now appears to be scratched even though I was super careful.

I’m pretty obsessive when aligning things and making sure it’s perfect so I was annoyed that I missed a speck of dust. Other screen protectors I have used in the past are more forgiving if you have to lift and replace them.

My advise to you is to check and double check that you have removed all dust (and while I didn’t have this problem, make sure it’s aligned properly too).  This protector is unforgiving. You get one shot at getting it right.","2.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I used it for just a couple of month and it broke completely where one of the chips were. This is not a very heavy duty protector. I'm just glad it saved my screen from breaking.

The crazy thing is it broke when I was on a flight and it was in my computer bag. My iPad pro has a case on it so the screen was not exposed. It is still a mystery how it actually broke.

I would not recommend this product. Waste of money.

I have 2 other iPads and I have had the same screen protectors on them for over a year and neither one of them even have a chip in them and I have used them everyday.

I received a replacement from SPARIN with video links for installing the screen glass.
This time around the glass fit Good but not perfect. I still feel like there is a bit space uncovered by the screen glass toward the right edges of the ipad pro 9.7.  And the Guide stickers provided with the package isn't used in the installation video, so I skipped that part myself. I wonder how it is used appropriately.
However, the positive aspect of it is there is no air bubbles trapped during the installation. And the biggest plus is, it doesn't hampers the functionality of apple pencil.

Old review:
The screen protector doesn't align well over the ipad screen. It is narrower toward the top and thereby leaves a large gap to one side of the ipad screen. Whats the point of screen protector which doesn't fit well over the ipad? Maybe I got a defective piece. I don't know.  I wrote to Sparin customer care and someone responded with a video link on how to install the protector, which doesn't solve the problem of it not fitting over the ipad screen.
Anyway, I can't recommend this product to anyone. Maybe only if you want to try your luck and get a good piece which fits.
The two stars is just for packaging and amazon's shipping.","4.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen protector I had on my iPad previously was way too thick and caused me to need to use excessive pressure to use the apple pencil to take notes. During a typical 50 minute lecture I would take 7-9 pages of notes on notability and with the old screen protector my arm would be exhausted by the end of the lecture. This screen protector is so good that it feels like it is not even on the iPad. I barely have to apply any pressure when writing to get the iPad to register the apple pencil. Also, I use my iPad as a TV. All the shows I watch are on Netflix and other streaming apps and the anti-glare on this screen protector is great.

""Hinge"" install method is only okay.","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 6 de mayo de 2020","SPARIN put forth a strong effort to try and create a simple and effective install solution that gets your screen protector into the right place but it ultimately falls short. They do so by using several stickers to create a ""hinge"" that lets you lay your screen protector aside your device like an open book, remove the protective film from the adhesive side and ""hinge"" the protector into place like you're closing a book. Sadly I found it's only okay at doing its job. Here's why:
--This method requires you to have the adhesive side facing up after you remove the film. That's a big problem because dust and things fall downwards - onto the protector. For that reason after removing the film you always want the adhesive side facing downwards, something you can't do in this situation.
--The ""hinges"" are flexible stickers that still allow limited movement of the protector with respect to the device. It only takes a small amount of movement to put you out of alignment and those stickers allow quite a bit more than a small amount. The stickers, ultimately, only prevent gross misalignment but do not stop the small errors that will drive you nuts every time you use your device.

Ultimately mine went on fairly well but I think SPARIN ought to research a more foolproof method. The best I've seen yet belongs to InvisibleShield who utilizes a rigid plastic frame to align the protector to the device throughout the application process. For $10 you're getting fair value for your money. I'm sure it will protect just as well as any other tempered glass product. I rated this three stars simply because I think the application process is absolutely critical to your enjoyment of the product. That's in my opinion as somebody who is driven crazy by tiny hairs or bits of junk stuck forever under the screen protector, sticking out every time you use the device.","3.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

That said, this went on fairly well. The biggest complaint is that the ""guide"" stickers were not adhesive enough to hold the glass in place as hinges, nor to use the third one as a handle to lower the glass onto the iPad. I ended up pulling the protector free of the hinges and just eyeballing it. I got three good sized bubbles toward the top, one silver dollar sized and the other two more dime sized. However, I was able to gently ease a fingernail under a corner and use the small, stiff, smoother to work the largest bubble to the edge. The two small air pockets were fairly easy to work to the edge using pressure on the protector. Once all is said and done, it's on as straight as can be expected - the circle is not exactly even over the button, but the sides look straight, and there are no bubbles nor dust apparent.

UPDATED: Great customer service repping a solid product!","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 6 de septiembre de 2018","UPDATE: I’ve upped my review to the full 5 stars after receiving a response from customer service—unsolicited—apologizing for the bubbling issue despite adhering like a sensei’s acolyte to the installation process. A replacement product was mailed—also unsolicited—and Alisa, the customer service rep, could not have been more helpful and apologetic. I appreciate that the retailer wasn’t full of mere words but actions backing its product, and to substantiate its confidence, the second screen protector was installed without incident. I admit it seemed like there again might persist some pockets of air but within a couple of minutes they had all adhered. I’ll attach an updated pic soon of the glossy screen.

In all, I’m pleased with it. Yeah, it took some hassle I didn’t seek, but the customer service made up for it. The product works well. I’d purchase again, and I’d completely recommend the product and retailer to others.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Bubbled in the middle of the screen. See pic. And I had prepped w/ the focus of a neurosurgeon scrubbing in for a craniotomy. I watched the YouTube instructional video thrice (thrice!), reviewed the instructional booklet, prepped my area and iPad, and dug into application. Followed everything precisely as guided. Went well, until it the cruel final.

And the guidance is good, if sometimes lengthy. There are many steps: dry fit the protector w/ the guidance sticker [advice:
APPLY STICKERS FIRMLY b/c they will def slip destroying your handiwork at the final], wet cleaning, dry cleaning, dusting up w/ sticker (a nice feature), and application. The application is nice w/ a quick suction followed by a little bit (theoretically) of ironing out of bubbles.

But my bubble—obtrusive, frustrating, distracting—betrays the point of the product.

Product may otherwise be nice. I can only stare at this diabolical bubble whenever my eye spies the screen and hope it’s sweetly, surely asphyxiated.","5.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Purchased 2 screen protectors in March, 2019 because the reviews were so good. I never had glass before and it seemed like a great product.

Last night I saw a deep gash on the left side and today I see a crack from the left side to the gash and then down to the bottom of the left side. I have no idea why this happened. My iPad is in a case with a keyboard which is made for it. I don’t leave my iPad open when not in use and I put nothing on top of it. Very disappointing.

The Guide stickers did not help me at all, I put all three of them on the side of the glass as directed but the glass slid off the iPad and I had to remove the stickers to re-align the glass to the iPad, so unnecessary steps were included.

It came beautifully packaged in a stiff cardboard ""book"" type box sealed with a label. When you open it there is a quality foam border all around the glass. The glass itself was inside a nice plastic sleeve inside of a soft foam envelope. The instructions, a nice company card with instructions on one side for if you are happy with the product how to share and leave a review, and if you are not happy on the other side a promise to make it right with customer service contact details, the application tools and stickers all inside of a nice unmarked kraft brown envelope. I'm not big on a lot of useless packaging but you can easily convert the box into something you could use again and definitely use the envelope again instead of them ending up in a landfill. As for the product itself...beautiful. You are given all the tools you need to apply this to your device. There is even a YouTube prompt on the instruction booklet so you can watch it live before you try. I had no problems at all getting this onto my iPad Pro. I even put it on crooked the first time and was able to slowly and carefully lift it back off and reapply it. Then, I did have a couple of air bubbles (the second time I applied it) and was able to easily lift each corner until the air bubbles were accessible and lay the glass back down perfectly. The one thing I think would have made it easier and might have kept me from having to do a second application is the the tab on the protective cover on the sticky side of the glass could have been on the ""bottom"" (where the home button is) instead of the top so that I could have lined that part up right away instead of last. The great thing is that the home button hole is the only hole to line up. This glass fits edge to edge and is beveled all the way around. Even the good one I have on my phone leaves a 1/8 - 1/4 inch gap all the way around. This glass is a great companion to the Bluetooth keyboard iPad case I also bought from an equally fabulous company. This company really put a lot of thought into all of their systems from packaging to product to customer service. That deserves a reward.

I’d mistakenly bought these thinking there as two in the pack... but there’s just one.  Rather pricey for just one when everyone else offering glass screen protectors for iPad 6/iPad Pro 9.7in at the same price point includes two.

Mine, when it arrived, was shipped in a thinly padded envelope.  The box had a crease in it.  When I initially looked at the screen protector, I didn’t see any cracks or damage so I installed.  The installation went well.  The n stand day, I noticed a big hairline crack. I couldn’t believe my eyes.  This is where the second one would’ve been useful/helpful.  I nearly ordered another different brand when a customer service rep sent me an email asking how the installation went.  I told them that on the second day there was a crack already and that it may have been damaged out of the box.  They quickly sent me a new one.

Would I recommend Sparin?  Yes, to a degree.  Watch the item your wanting to buy.  It seems they list several offerings of the same item but at different prices.  Usually one far more than the other.  And then some with just one when the other has two included.  And some at the same price as the just one.  Very tricky.  I took three stars off for the shipping, the damage and the resulting damage to the screen protector.  But I’ve added two stars back for the quick customer service response and their eagerness to send a replacement.","4.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first protector shattered from a short fall, with an excellent case protecting the device. I wanted a different brand but wasn’t clear about that before the order was made.

Both items were terrible to put on. The packaging, while impressive, worsens the situation. It causes increased static. If you use the ridiculous guide stickers, keep this is in mind. Not only will they allow shifting that will require lifting and secondary attempts, they increase the time for particles to build up. It’s better to just eyeball and adjust, which you won’t do if you just flop it over with the stickers.

The static draws everything to the adhesive side immediately. And the glass is fragile. It will crack during installation if you aren’t careful during adjustments. Or if you discover particles underneath...

The cleaning wipe is also absurd. Both times it created a film on a pre-cleaned surface. That requires extra time wiping after use.

The plastic tab for smoothing bubbles is a joke. Don’t waste time using it.

Just buy something else.","1.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, that's the problem.

Installation involves positioning the protector on the screen, and using stickers to create a sort of temporary hinge.  Once you've done that, there is a provided wet wipe to clean the screen, and a microfiber cloth to remove excess cleaner and fingerprints.  Next, the protective film must be removed from the glass, and here is where the problem lies.

Unless you have an ISO-9001 certified clean room at your disposal, I'm not sure how you can install this screen protector without getting any dust under it.  Removing the protective film creates such a buildup of static electricity that I could feel it, hear it, and even smell it.  It attracted dust out of the air, and by the time I got the glass onto my device and pressed down, the dust was sealed in.  It might not have been so bad, except that it creates a bubble around it where the glass is not in contact with the device, and it's very obvious, even for a small piece of dirt.

I removed the glass from the device, and attempted to remove the offending debris, but only succeeded in making the problem worse.  It quickly became apparent that I was not going to be able to use this screen protector.  I was very hopeful for a product that got so many positive reviews, but I am now disappointed.

Two stars, because as I said, if you can manage to get it installed without dust, it probably works just fine.  Good luck.

UPDATE: I was contacted by Sparin regarding my review above, and they offered to provide me with a free replacement.  We had a bit of email difficulty, but kudos for excellent customer service.  I received the replacement today, and I just happened to have a room in my house where I had just remodeled, so it was clean, clean, clean.  I applied the screen protector there, using the no stickers method (search YouTube for ""SPARIN A02""), which I would highly recommend.  This time, I got the screen protector installed on my iPad with no dust and only minor bubbles, which I was able to work out.  As I predicted above, once the screen protector is applied with no dust, dirt, or bubbles under it, it looks fine.  It feels smooth to the touch, as you'd expect for glass, and it doesn't add much in the way of thickness.  My case still fit around my iPad with no issues.  It seems to be pretty scratch resistant.  As for shattering, only time will tell (or hopefully, it won't!).

I'm updating my rating from 2 stars to 4, based on the customer service, and the apparent quality of the product (once you get it installed properly).","4.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had it on a table to watch videos, and when it wasn’t on the table, it was inside a nice thick cushioned laptop bag.

I have upped the stars from 1/5 to 3/5 just because of the fantastic customer service. Seller was confident about their product and had sent me a new screen hoping that this would fit better. That said, it was of the same dimensions and I have the same complaint about the product in which the screen protector does not cover edge to edge display. This may be ok for some, but really bugs me. So please buy at your own discretion, knowing that the screen is not cover edge to edge, but seller provides fantastic customer service.","3.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There was also a link for a youtube video for instructions on the application process.
The only reason for missing out 1 star here was that despite following the instructions to the T, there was still a bit of bubbling visible beneath the surface of the screen protector. I managed to push away the bubbles but that did leave a bit of ""refractive"" mark below the screen.

You either get unsightly bubbles from dust specks (no matter how much you wipe), or the positioning is off (no matter how much you line it up) - and while you are adjusting it, the underside is attracting dust like there is no tomorrow!

Which is why THIS screen protector is head and shoulders above the rest. It came in the pictured light yellow cardstock folio (kind of like an iPad case)- not necessary but A+ for presentation. It also had a ton of accessories including positioning stickers (no more readjusting!), 3 different kinds of wipes (wet, dry, and microfiber), and a dust removing sticker. The tempered glass itself looks and feels exactly like your shiny new iPad screen so you're not sacrificing visual or tactile sophistication for the sake of protection. And the best part is it's self-adhering - just lightly touch it to your (perfectly clean) screen and watch it work! Barely any extra squeezing or pressing is needed. I followed the instructions exactly and ended up with only one tiny bubble which I pressed out easily, which NEVER happens.

Also, it was a little difficult to discern which side was the adhesive side, so just keep in mind the red sticker in the corner goes on the right side lol. Don't end up like me and get it perfectly aligned only to find out you have the wrong side down..  And after all of that, I did end up having huuuuge bubbles on the right side of my screen opposite of the hinges.

Let me start by saying this screen protector is probably fine for most people. However, I am one of those extremely picky and borderline obsessive people when it comes to the way my device's screens look and perform.

CONS:
Glare... The screen of the iPad Pro is something very unique in that it has a new anti-glare coating that works extremely well. Especially when outdoors. I primarily use this iPad when flying my Phantom drone so this is very important to me. I thought maybe there was a chance that putting this thing on would only slightly degrade this anti-glare coating, but boy was I wrong! Having this protector on the iPad made it almost unusable outside - worse than the Air/Air 2 screen. Bottom line here, it's a shame to even think about putting anything over the iPad Pro's stock glass!

Distortion... I noticed that aside from the glare, at certain angles the picture was slightly distorted. There were also strange rainbow-looking artifacts in certain lighting which started driving me crazy.

PROS:
Packaging... The protector comes packaged extremely well with ample instructions and tools to get it installed correctly.

Oleophobic coating... The glass is covered in a film that feels silky smooth when you touch it and also repels fingerprints and dust very well.

Price... You can't beat the price of this thing for what you get.

Customer service... This company has been great to work with. It's always comforting to purchase from a company that takes pride in their product.

CONCLUSION:

If you're not going to be using your iPad outside a whole lot and you are not a snobby perfectionist like myself, this is a great option.","4.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

That's happened to us maybe unfortunately twice since owning iPads. The glass case is what broke on us, not the actual iPad which is the purpose of these cases.  Recently my son dropped our iPad and the screen completely shattered.  At first I thought it wasn't a big deal, it was just the protector screen, we could peel it off and the iPad should be fine right? That's what happened in the past... well, Not this time.  Our iPad was completely shattered and the screen was not tempered glass as it said it was.  It was plastic.  It peeled right off, and went right back on over the shattered glass.  When the iPad fell typically the tempered glass case is what breaks.  It shouldn't be able to peel off and go back on.  It should be broken and unusable once taken off. Because it's happened in the past and our iPad was perfectly fine, but the protector case was cracked.  The fact that I thought our iPad was protected this entire time, and now my iPad is shattered because we really had a plastic case on it and not glass is what really upsets me. We have never had our iPad shatter using a tempered glass protector screen.  So this clearly is not tempered glass.

Thick, sturdy, actually has a full cutout for the fingerprint sensor (unlike some I've seen), and is crystal clear. I give it 3 stars based on their install process, and my recommendations for a better install. Due to a job I previously held I used to do screen protector installations on a daily basis, and have installed countless screen protectors. With that said, I was intrigued by their sticker hinge install idea. I thought it might be the best install process I've seen yet, however the stickers didn't stick well to the screen protector, and stuck too much to my iPad, leaving a residue that I had to rub off. Their dust magnet tool also leaves residue on the screen, so I recommend to skip the dust magnet step. A microfiber and some elbow grease can get a screen perfectly clean. I recommend cleaning the screen before attaching the sticker hinge as while cleaning, if your iPad moves on the table, it drags the screen protector across the table potentially scratching it. Use lots of light and turn off ALL the fans/air conditioning or heating to keep as much dust from floating around as possible. wait about 10 minutes after everything is off to let the dust settle, then clean the screen very well. Tempered glass screen protectors show dust under the screen protector much more obviously than typical vinyl screen protectors. I have also docked another star for the poor bevel on the fingerprint cutout, causing it to be somewhat sharp. I hope this helps.

Unfortunately, I’m not impressed. My last one went on perfectly and easily. This one, despite my cleaning the screen, had dust particles attached to the adhesive. I could not remove them and they created large bubbles. Two of the corners did not adhere properly (despite following installation instructions) and so constantly appear to have large bubbles behind them. The anti-glare is just ok in lamplight and terrible in sunlight. The fingerprint smudges are also very prominent. The screen works just fine with the protector on it, though, and it’s thick so it should keep the screen from getting scratched or breaking (so long as it stays glued to it.)

I’ve actually purchased this product twice due to my kids breaking my screen, no fault of the quality of the screen replacement kit. It’s super easy to install (Look up a tutorial on youtube BEFORE you begin). But be aware the Touch ID function does NOT work with the replacement home button. So if possible, try to use your original home button when replacing. I made the mistake of accidentally breaking mine when I took the iPad apart the first time so I’m stuck with the replacement. But overall super happy with this screen replacement kit. Paired it up with a good screen protector and heavy duty case so fingers crossed that this will be the last time I have to replace it.

Lucky for me, while the crack was not attractive it didn't create any issues with usability. Checked about getting it fixed but a replacement screen cost almost as much as a refurbished iPad. Since the crack was barely noticeable, decided to get a screen protector to guard against any further damage. Saw many comments warning against using a screen protector after a crack, but followed the instructions (both the booklet and the YouTube video) and it went on easily, without any bubbles. There was a little air pocket that formed along the crack but I used my fingers and the enclosed squeegee to get rid of that.

Never had one of this quality before.  It was super simple to apply  although I admit I did not have the patience to use the included wet/dry wipes or the marker stickers.  I simply cleaned my screen with a microfiber cloth, removed the plastic to reveal the adhesive, then lined up the home button and the sides of the iPad before slowly lowering the protector onto it.  That's it.  Literally had zero bubbles or dust underneath.  The thing that truly blew my mind though was the coating.  I don't know what kind of oleophobic nanotechnology this company is using but it does NOT pick up fingerprints.  At ALL.  I tried smudging and smearing and dragging my fingers all over it.

One thing: While I do appreciate the inclusion of the 'installation kit' for guaranteeing an absolutely perfect application of the protector, I find that just by eyeballing it and being halfway dexterous, I can put it on just fine (and perfectly, no bubbles after smoothing it down) with no assistance needed.

I bought it to safeguard my 2017 iPad Air 2. The item was delivered on time and well packaged. The protector itself is so thin it's hard to believe it is glass but it is. The installation was very simple. Clean the glass with the products included and use the sticky film to remove any minute dust or particle and using the adhesive tabs to create a ""book"", peel the film back from the down side of the protector and drop in place.  Make sure to follow the directions and if you need to (I did because I was a little nervous I'd screw it up and must buy another one) follow a tutorial on YouTube. The protector really does adhere itself to the glass and I had only a minor bubble to push aside. It was easier than I thought it would be. The cut outs for the home button, camera, etc. line up perfectly. The thinness of the protector does not in any way interfere with the touch functions of my tablet.

On my first try to install it I ruined it. The stickers that are supposed to keep it in the original position before you take off the sticky side protector weren't fastened properly and they came off. As a result it wasn't positioned correctly and when I tried to fix it, it got ruined. Once you touch the inner (sticky) side it's done - can't be cleaned and can't be re-fitted. Following my complaint the company sent me a new one, and I was able to install it properly.
I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by the customer service, kudos on that!

The protector is very clear and seems very strong. Really the only down side is that the installation step is delicate with an iPad.

After that, the stickers did not stick well, making the protector crooked right before I was ready to pull off the protective layer and install. At some point a crack formed on the side opposite the home button. I decided to try to continue installation to protect the iPad until I could replace this protective glass. I gently tried to unstick the installation stickers and reposition which then resulted in a huge crack.

I haven't dropped it nor given any damages (that I remember of) so I am very curious as to how it chipped and it's slowly making itself larger.
I would have said it may not be for me but people who don't take their iPad outside should be fine BUT I am one of those people who doesn't take their iPad outside of home. So would I recommend this one to a friend? No.

INITIAL REVIEW: Initially I was quite pleased with this screen protector. Much better price than the ones I looked at in stores, sturdy packaging, and reasonably easy to apply following the diagram-based instructions. However, it has since started to peel up in the lower corner. At first it was just at the very edge, but now there is a five or six square inch section that is no longer contacting the screen. I am very careful with my electronics (and have only logged a few dozen hours on this iPad), and have not tested the protective features of this product, so my low scoring review is based simply upon aesthetic dissatisfaction.

Easy to install - #1 tip is to use that dust sticker they give you after cleaning it with the wipes, no fan on, etc. Look straight down at device when applying, not from an angle.  The “hinge” stickers weren’t really needed in my opinion, but is a good concept and I see how it could be helpful. Low smudge for sure, fingerprints are barely noticeable if at all.

I did have two small spots where air bubbles were trapped, and couldn't be moved to the edge. This irritated me at first, but on practical use I find they are so small and unobtrusive that I don't notice them. In fact, I have to look for them to see them. So that turned out to be a non-problem.

The glass looks very strong, and using the machine after installation is, functionally, exactly like using it beforehand. Packaging was great and the whole product exudes a top-o'-the-line aura.

I just used the wet alcohol wipe to clean the screen and then the dry one to clean it up. Then I peeled the plastic off of the protector, lined it up on a corner, and then started laying it down from the top right corner to the bottom left corner. It got a bubble, but I just lifted and put the screen back down till it went away. It does seem to get some smudges on it, but my fingers just seem to smudge screens more overall. I feel really good about the protector if I were to drop it, and the price can’t be beat for the items and support included in the package.

I tried this product to replace my old screen protector of a different brand.

This screen protector has way too much glare. It's very hard to draw with mirror like reflections on the screen. Perhaps it would work in a dark room -- but as the purpose of an iPad is to be mobile, that would be rediculous.

Additionally, and I really don't know how or what this happens. The automatic screen brightness adjust feature doesn't seem to be working. For those unfamiliar, the iPad Pro has an amazing feature where is senses the lighting brightness and color of the room and automatically adjusts the iPad to deliver a consistent screen brightness no matter the setting. The screen I am currently writing this review on is quite dark. This is very frustrating.

I'm sure the screen protector must have some virtues in strength, but 2 strikes against it have caused me to order a different screen protector to replace this one.

I do not think this is a good choice for the iPad Pro.","2.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You do need to be careful about proper alignment and making sure he screen is really clean before application.

Followed reviewer suggestions for optimal placement.","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 3 de marzo de 2018","Arrived on time, well packaged, undamaged. As per the advice of other reviewers, I allowed the screen protector 24 hours to come to room temperature before installing. I hate bubbles, so I found a clean library room and waited until the AC fan was off (didn't want anything blowing around). Pre-cleaned my screen with an old lens cloth just because I'm paranoid. The cleaning kit that came with the screen protector is appreciated, although there were two items that weren't mentioned in the instructions: one dry wipe, and a pull tab (I assumed it was to be used to position the screen, although I didn't use it and did fine). As per instrutions, I pre-positioned the screen protector, then applied the hinge stickers. I realized too late that I had placed the screen protector wrong-side up, but no worries! The hinge stickers weren't excessively sticky, and I was able to remove them without problems or damage. I re-placed the screen protector and hinge stickers, and gave placement a few practice tries as per other reviewers suggestions. I followed the cleaning instructions, and if I could take just half a star off, I would: the dust wipe left a film on the screen that, had I not noticed, would have caused problems. No worries, the microfiber dust cloth took care of the film and the screen was pristine. I placed the screen protector easily, sealed it to the screen, and removed the hinge stickers. Works beautifully, and I honestly can't even tell its here except that the glare is noticeably reduced (which is why I purchased this in the first place).","5.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Reading the experiences of other users also convinced me that trying to remove the particle would be worse than just leaving it alone.

I had to look for one that would work for me especially when it comes to smudges. I use my iPad a lot in the kitchen, so you can only imagine! I ordered this SPARIN Tempered Glass Screen protector. I read the instructions on the small booklet and the direction to watch SPARIN A09 video on YouTube. That helped simplify things! However, I missed the placement of the iPad (which direction the home button was supposed to be facing before installing! When all was done, I didn’t have a home button! Of course it was there but covered with the screen protector! Went back to see if I read it wrong which iPad it works for and truly it works for my iPad Air 9.7”. The lights came on that watching the video, I didn’t pay attention to how the iPad was laid down and what was facing where! I took the risk of using the little card scrapper (comes in the installation package) to gently tip one corner and the carefully grab the protector without touching the inside (that touches the screen), then after peeling it off, holding by the edges turn it around to where the opening for the home button is directly centered over my home button and then gently place it and even it out! Didn’t need to reclean the screen, not even touch it. After the screen protector laid squarely on the iPad, I then used the same card and the wipe cloth provided to squish out the air bubbles. I ended up with a perfect, very responsive screen and found the home button too! Should you mess up as I did, wait till the disappointment wears off to redo it!","4.0 de 5 estrellas","Página siguiente→","https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Oh, and the ""hinges"" don't stick","Calificado en Estados Unidos el 24 de agosto de 2019","I watched the video, read the instructions several times. Seemed easy enough. I used the stickies to create the hinges. I had a brand new iPad, literally just took the factory packaging off. Not even a smudge. Followed the directions, but when I took the protective backing off as described, the sticky hinge they provided did NOT stick (tho pressed very firmly) to my iPad and my screen protector was VERY crooked. So I gently lifted it to straighten. When lifting it, dust and dirt attached the underside of the protector (not the screen, screen was spotless still) Couldn't remove dirt from sticky side of protector, so now I have flecks ALL OVER the screen. No can do. And it all started because their ""hinges"" didn't adhere to the iPad. Might be better to just align it yourself without the ""hinges"".

If you watch the video first and follow the steps EXACTLY you will have a completely clear screen protector. The only minor issues were that I had to push quite hard to get the last bubbles and the hinge won’t give you a perfect alignment but it’s not noticeable, especially if you have a Fintie cover as I do. One review said to apply the screen protector in a bathroom with the shower running which I did and I can’t say for certain this is necessary but a dust free environment is critical.  Even if you follow the steps exactly, if there is dust around it may show up on the screen. This is by far the best screen protector I’ve ever applied and so far as I’m concerned it’s earned the almost 5 star average rating. The other plus is that I priced a screen protector at Best Buy.

When I removed it today to replace I was  unpleasantly surprised that the crack was also in the screen of the Ipad itself. I'm not very happy about it. I went ahead and replaced it with this anyway. Since I had already purchased it and prepped the Ipad. I understand that things can crack a screen through a protector, for example a hammer or a brick. That is not what happened in this case.

Most of them were fairly competent in their function but they all share one flaw. Putting a protective layer of any kind always seems takes away from the picture. Yes, even if its just clear, plastic just doesn't reflect the same way, just doesn't look as sharp to me as the original glass. Maybe I'm crazy but thats been my experience thus far. I accept that with a full surround case or a screen protector I will be sacrificing image quality, especially as the plastic protector ages. Having said all of this, this is the single best screen protector I have ever purchased. Easy to install, comes with literally everything you need to install it, and once its in place there is absolutely zero image quality difference whatsoever, like zero, the picture seriously looks exactly as it does without it on.

Cheap manufacturing processes can allow a very slight distortion in the tempered glass protector and air bubbles will appear immediately or within a few days.
